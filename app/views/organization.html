              <p>Jerome Williams has dedicated the majority of his adult life to public service. After 8 years of honorable service in the U.S. Army as a medical specialist, he returned home to be the primary caregiver for his aging parents. Later he gained employment with Orange County Public Schools. After 22 years of service with the school system, he retired in 2010. He is now an AARP volunteer leader and advocate. He is actively involved with the Livable Communities movement and focuses on making communities in Florida better for people of all ages, and aims to improve access to reliable transportation for seniors. </p>

              <p>In 1985 Mr. Williams was handpicked by Callahan Neighborhood Assn, Inc. (CNA) leaders to become the organization's first Executive Director. The small grassroots organization of predominately senior citizens worked for fair allocation of public resources for the neighborhood of Parramore, Florida, Mr. Williams' home town. He worked with the City of Orlando and CNA to create the Callahan/Holden Neighborhood Plan where he established outreach programs, monitored the Community Development Block Grant allocation, as well as financial reporting and records. His direct involvement with the project resulted in paved streets, new drainage systems, approved compatible zoning, and for the first time in 50 years, the construction of new housing within the community.</p>

                <h2>The Power of Technology</h2>
                <p>Our proprietary ITNRidesâ„¢ software system enables us to leverage our expertise and to simplify operations for all our affiliates.</p>

                <p>It connects every ITN affiliate community into one effective centralized national network that manages the logistics of the senior transportation service, including member and volunteer management and ride scheduling.</p>

                <p>All ITN affiliates access the software through an internet connection and store their information at our secure data center. The collected data is used for a variety of purposes; including helping social researchers better understand senior mobility and its effects on society. ITN technology provides everything needed to deliver logistical efficiency to a very complex problem.</p>

                <p>ITN is quickly linking cities and citizens across the country and that's just the beginning. Soon, ITN will grow beyond the cities and suburbs to the small towns and rural communities where the unmet need is so great. Our goal is to provide the expertise, tools and state-of-the-art technology that will allow small organizations to serve more and more people without additional resources or funds.
